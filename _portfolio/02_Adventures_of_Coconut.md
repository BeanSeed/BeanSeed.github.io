When I first created this game I solely used the drag-and-drop (DND) feature in GameMaker 8.
I had no concept of variables, no concept of datastructures, and no concept of classes.
I was starting from ground zero, with no formal knowledge of programming or game design.
The only knowledge that I did have was that code is executed from the top going down.

All of the artwork is done by me as well. Using various tools like the GM built-in sprite editor and GIMP 2.
To say the least, I'm no professional.

Experimenting with the platform genre and applying my knowledge of classical mechanics, there was much testing to get the physics just right.
The jumping, climbing, and walking had to be smooth and feel intuitive for player.

An everlasting challenge in game design is to create interesting and engaging boss fights. 
Each boss has to have their own style but also fit with the player's mechanics and challenge the player
to think about their available toolset.

Unfortunately this game project was never completed as I had started college at the time.
Nevertheless, there is a playable alpha-version free to download below.
