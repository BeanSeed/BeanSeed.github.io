First fully playable game that I created.  
Originally conceived from consequence of learning how to use GameMaker 7, it grew and changed 
as I explored game design and computer science.

In 2010, Gloops was planned to be submitted to [YoyoGames'](https://www.yoyogames.com) 05 Competition 
for a chance  to be put on the PSP. The game was redesigned for omnidirectional movement, game 
progression, and story. However, due to personal circumstances, the game was never finished for this platform.
Eventually Gloops was redesigned with great care for the touch-screen mobile platform.
It was finished and published on the APple iStore in 2013 until 2015.

Currently, Gloops has been redesigned as an arcade style game, best played with a gamepad.
You can play any of the version I have available below.
