Who doesn't like blowing things away with a massive tank?
And when there is an endless horde of zombies, the fun never stops.

Originally Rogue Tank was a top-down free movement point-and-shoot game.
It was later turned into a "finish the path and play." Created to support
touch screen and make gameplay easier, the necessity of maneuvering 
the tank was removed which permitted an increased focus on spraying zombies with bullets.
